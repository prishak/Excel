Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups (predicting which group each one belongs to) on the basis of a classification rule. Contexts requiring a decision as to whether or not an item has some qualitative property, some specified characteristic, or some typical binary classification include:  
  
  
  Let us consider a two-class prediction problem (binary classification), in which the outcomes are labeled either as positive (p) or negative (n).   
There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier.   
If the outcome from a prediction is p and the actual value is also p, then it is called a **true positive (TP)**;  
however if the actual value is n then it is said to be a **false positive (FP)**.   
Conversely, a **true negative (TN)** has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are n,  
and **false negative (FN)** is when the prediction outcome is n while the actual value is p.
